# Webots
The aim of the project is to design and create a robot using Webots software and to enable the robot to navigate automatically. The first goal is that the robot can successfully escape a maze that it has already seen; the second goal is that the robot can successfully escape a maze that it has not seen; and the third goal is that the robot can still successfully escape by adding moving obstacles to the maze based on the second goal. The robot will have two minutes to escape the maze and the performance will be judged on how far it gets from the target and how many collisions it has with the environment or obstacles during the two minutes. 
This project report is a description of the project realization process, from the design of the robot, the creation of the robot, and the navigation strategies and algorithms used for each of the three objectives.
